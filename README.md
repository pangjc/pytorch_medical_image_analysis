# pytorch_medical_image_analysis

This repo aims to create a pytorch warehouse for (medical) image analysis consisting of classification, detection, segmentation (2D and 3D)

## Classification

Our goal for this part is to train a classifier that can predict whether a patient's X-Ray indicates the presence of pneumonia or not. To achieve this, we will be utilizing the RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge dataset, which can be found at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge/data
